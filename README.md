# KSP_TechTree_SpaceColonization
Custom parts and modifications of vanilla and addon parts for my space-colonization-focused low-tech-start Kerbal Space Program career.

## Requirements
Nox Spaceworks TechTree is required, get it here: https://github.com/paranox/KSP_NoxSpaceworks_TechTree

## Features
You start out with very low-tech unmanned probes and you shouldn't expect to reach space immediately. It will be much easier to get basic manned airplanes than basic manned rockets that reach space.

## Mod list
I don't want to include the mods themselves since I don't want to check their licenses for permission. Therefore I'll only list them here and possibly also a link to download them if they're somewhat difficult to find.

- RemoteTech 1.8.13.131
