	description = Have you ever wondered why your fancy rocket just stands there on the launchpad and not doing anything while you smack the launch button with all your might? Did you remember to check if the remote control wires were connected? Yeah, as we thought, you didn't. This handy device guarantees a wired connection to Mission Control while on the launchpad. The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance. It also makes a note that mounting rockets wider than the device itself is strongly discouraged, or anything heavy, really.
