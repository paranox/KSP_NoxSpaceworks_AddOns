	description = Allows RemoteTech probe cores to contact ships and Mission Control within 1 km without the need for a dedicated antenna. This simulates wired controls on KSC Launchpad even though it also enables vessel to vessel communication in-flight. It's not like you're going to benefit from that too much.
